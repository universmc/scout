Based on the information provided, the following is a summary of the incident and its aftermath:

On January 18, 2023, Fabien Grimaud, a 42-year-old roofer, participated in a protest in Paris with other BTP workers. The protest was declared and the route was pre-determined. However, the police blocked the protesters near Gare de l'Est, causing chaos and leading to a violent confrontation. Grimaud was hit by an explosion and was injured. He was taken to the nearby hospital Lariboisi√®re where the medical staff treated his injuries and expressed their concerns about the lack of resources and support they receive.

Grimaud calls on the French people to take action against the unfair and liberty-limiting measures imposed by the government. He criticizes those who complain about the situation but do not take to the streets to show their discontent. He emphasizes the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth in the country and warns that the current situation is creating radicalization and unrest among those who seek a fairer society. He addresses the government, ministers, parliament, and the police, urging them to address the issue of wealth distribution and prevent the situation from escalating further.

Grimaud's statement is not a threat, but a warning of the potential consequences if the government does not take action to address the concerns of its citizens. He stresses that a fair and just society is necessary for the well-being of all.
