Based on the information you've provided, it seems like you're interested in gathering information related to the Commission nationale des comptes de campagne et de la formation politique (CNCCFP) and possibly other related resources. Here are some queries you could use with the Groq data exploration tool to get started:

1. To search for all documents in the `grief` directory that contain the term "CNCCFP":

```groq
*[type == "file" && path == path("grief/*") && contains(plaintext, "CNCCFP")]
