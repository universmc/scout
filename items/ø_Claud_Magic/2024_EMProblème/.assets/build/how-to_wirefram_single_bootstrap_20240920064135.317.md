  

Please clarify your request! 

It seems like you're trying to ask for a guide on how to wireframe using Bootstrap.  To make sure I give you the best possible instructions, I need a little more information. 

Could you please tell me:

* **What are you trying to wireframe?** A website? A mobile app? A specific feature?
* **What is your experience level with wireframing and Bootstrap?** Are you a beginner, intermediate, or advanced user?
* **What are your specific goals for the wireframe?** Are you trying to create a low-fidelity prototype for user testing, or a more detailed visual representation of the design?


Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can create a helpful and relevant How-To guide for you.
