Please provide me with more context!  I need to know what kind of single-page website or app you want to wireframe. 

For example, tell me:

* **What is the purpose of the website/app?** (e.g.,  portfolio, landing page, online store, blog post)
* **Who is the target audience?** (e.g., potential clients, customers, readers)
* **What are the key features or actions users should be able to take?** (e.g., view a gallery, make a purchase, subscribe to a newsletter)

The more information you give me, the more helpful and specific my wireframing guide can be!
