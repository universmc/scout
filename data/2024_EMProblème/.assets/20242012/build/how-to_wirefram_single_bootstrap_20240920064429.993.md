Please provide me with more context!  What kind of wireframe are you trying to create? 

For example, tell me:

* **What is the purpose of the wireframe?** (e.g., a website landing page, a mobile app login screen, a dashboard)
* **What are the key elements you want to include?** (e.g., buttons, text fields, images, navigation menus)
* **What specific tool are you using for wireframing?** (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, even pen and paper)
* **Do you have any specific design considerations?** (e.g., responsiveness, accessibility)


The more information you give me, the more helpful and specific my guide can be.
