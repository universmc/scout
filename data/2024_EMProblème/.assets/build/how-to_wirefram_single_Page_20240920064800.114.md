 I need more information to create a helpful guide! 

Please tell me:

* **What kind of single-page application are you wireframing?** (e.g., landing page, portfolio, contact form, product detail page)
* **What tools are you using to wireframe?** (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Balsamiq, pen and paper)
* **What specific aspects of wireframing are you struggling with?** (e.g., layout, content hierarchy, navigation)
* **What is your level of experience with wireframing?** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)


The more details you provide, the better I can tailor the guide to your needs.
