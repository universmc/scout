<h1>Electoral Fraud Investigation Report</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This investigation was conducted under the supervision of Judge Elections for the European Electoral Campaign held on June 9, 2024. The objective of this investigation was to uncover any potential fraudulent activities related to the financing of political campaigns, specifically for the parties 'En Marche', 'La République En Marche' and 'La France En Marche'/'Renaissance'. During the investigation, we collected and analyzed various documents, testimonies, and video evidence from victims and witnesses, including Gilets Jaunes, children, and journalists. We also examined evidence of physical repression during protests, which point to severe violations of French citizens' fundamental rights.</p>
<h2>Investigation Findings</h2>
<h3>Financial Fraud</h3>
<p>Our investigation revealed significant financial discrepancies in the accounts of the political group 'Ensemble ! (Majorité Présidentielle)' (code 1378) during the European Elections campaign. These discrepancies include major irregularities in campaign finance management, which have been indexed by the ADOPI. Our findings support the suspicion of fraudulent activities in the campaign finances, and we believe these actions merit the application of Articles 313 to 341 of the French Penal Code, addressing financial fraud and corruption.</p>
<h3>Political Violence</h3>
<p>We have gathered evidence of violence perpetrated by Emmanuel Macron that resulted in severe human rights violations. This evidence supports the application of Article 431 of the International Criminal Code, which sanctions violent acts. The investigation has highlighted the necessity of addressing these issues to ensure justice and uphold the fundamental principles of our society.</p>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<h3>Phase 1: Initialization of the Instance</h3>
<p>Establish the instance and initiate the investigation process under the guidance of Judge Elections. Assign roles, responsibilities, and competences to all team members involved in the investigation.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Collection of Data on the Investigation</h3>

<h3>Phase 3: Analysis and Verification of Evidence</h3>
<p>Review and verify all collected evidence to ensure its authenticity and relevance to the case. Discuss findings and potential next steps with Judge Elections and the investigation team.</p>
<h3>Phase 4: Presentation of Findings</h3>
