In order to help you, I would need more information about what you are trying to do. However, based on the information you have provided, it seems like you are trying to gather information about a specific case involving potential financial fraud, use of force, and misconduct by high-ranking officials and a political party. To move forward, you could consider the following steps:

1. Gather all relevant documents and evidence related to the case, including financial records, witness statements, and any other relevant materials.
2. Consult with a lawyer or legal expert who specializes in financial fraud and election law to understand your options and the best course of action.
3. File a complaint with the relevant authorities, such as the prosecutor's office or the national financial crimes agency, and provide them with all the evidence and information you have gathered.
4. Consider reaching out to journalists or media outlets to bring attention to the case and put pressure on the authorities to take action.
5. If you are a victim or witness, you may also consider seeking support from victim's advocacy groups or organizations that specialize in political corruption and financial fraud.

Regarding the use of Groq, GPT, Mistral, and the Dalloz legal code, it is not clear how these tools would be applicable to this situation. Groq is a programming language for querying data, GPT is a type of artificial intelligence model, Mistral is a French weather forecasting model, and the Dalloz legal code is a collection of French legal texts. It is possible that these tools could be useful in some way, but additional information would be needed to make a more informed recommendation.
