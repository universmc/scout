It seems like your Groq query is incomplete. Groq is a data processing query language, and the query you've provided so far is not a valid Groq command.

If you're trying to create a message response template, here's an example using the information you provided:

/template +[message/.response]
------
{
  "response": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The composition of this message is based on the provided JSON specification at session.timestamp. Here is the formulated command: `910.Json`"
      }
    ]
  }
}
------

This template has a single message in the "messages" array, with a "role" of "assistant" and a "content" field that contains the desired response text. You can modify the content field or add more messages as needed.
