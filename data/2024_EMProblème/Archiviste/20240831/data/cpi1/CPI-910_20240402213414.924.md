Sure, I can help you with that! It seems like you're looking to gather resources related to the topic of "grief" and possibly some other legal or governmental resources. Here are some suggestions:

* Groq is a query language for working with large datasets, so you might want to use it to search for relevant information in a specific dataset or database. Here are some example Groq queries based on what you provided:
	+ `groq -l grief/*.csv` (assuming you have CSV files in a directory called "grief")
	+ `groq -l grief/Affaire_910-ref-légal_dalloz.json` (assuming you have a JSON file called "Affaire\_910-ref-légal\_dalloz.json" in a directory called "grief")
	+ `groq -l [object Object]` (I'm not sure what this is supposed to represent - you might want to clarify?)
* For resources related to the legal code and governmental institutions you mentioned, here are some links that might be helpful:
	+ [CNCCFP (Commission nationale des comptes de campagne et des financements politiques)](https://www.cnccfp.fr/partis-politiques/)
	+ [Legifrance (the French government's legal database)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/)
	+ [French government budget website](https://budget.gouv.fr/)
* You might also find it helpful to use advanced search features on these websites to narrow down your search results. For example, on Legifrance, you can use the "recherche avancée" (advanced search) feature to search for specific terms or codes within the legal code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
