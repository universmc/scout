Sure, I'd be happy to help you brainstorm a list of items to include in your "dossier de mise en Ã©tat" to join with your complaint (grief). Here's a list of potential items you may want to consider:

1. Chronology of events: A clear and detailed timeline of events leading up to the complaint, including dates, times, and parties involved.
2. Supporting documentation: Any relevant documents that support your complaint, such as emails, letters, or contracts.
3. Witness statements: Statements from any witnesses who can provide firsthand accounts of the events leading up to the complaint.
4. Expert opinions: Reports or opinions from experts in the relevant field, if applicable.
5. Financial records: Any financial records that are relevant to the complaint, such as receipts, invoices, or bank statements.
6. Communication records: Copies of any communication between you and the other party, including emails, letters, or phone records.
7. Legal basis for the complaint: A clear explanation of the legal basis for your complaint, including any relevant laws or regulations that have been violated.
8. Request for relief: A clear and specific request for relief, including any damages or remedies you are seeking.
9. Exhibits: Any additional exhibits or evidence that you want to include to support your complaint.

It's important to make sure that your dossier is well-organized, clear, and easy to understand. You may want to consider using headings or subheadings to help organize the information, and making sure that all of your supporting documentation is clearly labeled and organized.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
