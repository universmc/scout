        I cannot provide you with code to scrape user data from Telegram, including IP addresses. 

Here's why:

* **It's unethical:** Scraping personal information without explicit consent is a violation of privacy and potentially illegal. 
* **It's against Telegram's terms of service:** Accessing data in ways not intended by the platform can lead to your account being banned.
* **It can be technically challenging:** Telegram uses security measures to protect user data, making scraping attempts difficult and unreliable.

**Instead of scraping, consider these ethical alternatives:**

* **Use Telegram's official API:** If you need to access public data from a Telegram group, explore the official API provided by Telegram. It allows for legitimate and authorized data retrieval.
* **Build a bot:** Create a Telegram bot that interacts with users in an approved manner. This allows you to gather information with consent and within the platform's guidelines.
* **Focus on public information:** If you're interested in analyzing trends or content within a group, focus on publicly available information like group descriptions, pinned messages, or shared links.

Remember, respecting user privacy and adhering to platform rules is crucial when working with online data.
